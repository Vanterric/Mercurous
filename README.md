## 🧾 What It Does

### 💸 Financial Management (Offline-First)

Track your money with precision and zero fluff:

- **Fixed Costs:** Log recurring monthly and weekly obligations (rent, subscriptions, etc.)
- **Daily Expenses:** Log purchases on the fly and organize them into weekly pushes
- **Income Tracking:** Add paychecks and view average monthly income
- **Needs vs Wants:** Set monthly allowance caps to maintain balance and avoid impulsive overreach
- **Buckets:** Create custom “buckets” (e.g., *Fun*, *Medical*, *Savings*) for pre-allocating capital and budgeting intentionally

Whether you're paycheck-to-paycheck or planning your next investment — Mercurous is your personal ledger, planner, and clarity tool.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Companion Mode: Relationship Insights

Because life isn’t just numbers.

Track and reflect on your **personal connections**:

- **Thumbs Up / Down:** After each conversation, rate the vibe — was it a net positive or negative interaction?
- **Contact Profiles:** Log interactions per contact, with progress bars that visualize relationship strength over time
- **Notes & Logs:** Jot down important details or reminders from past interactions for more thoughtful follow-ups

This component helps you keep your emotional ledger as tidy as your financial one.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a system that could:

- Work **offline** without needing to sync to the cloud
- Help me **stay honest** about my expenses and planning
- Encourage me to be more **deliberate** in both how I spend my money and nurture my relationships

Mercurous was born out of necessity (and fun): a lightweight, mobile-first command center for personal clarity.
